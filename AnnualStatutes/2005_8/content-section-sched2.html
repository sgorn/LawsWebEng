TAXATION OF INCOME</h2><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 6<br>Income from Immovable Property</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting or use in any other form of immovable property and to income from the alienation of such property.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 7<br>Business Profits</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs of this Article, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Where profits include items which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 8<br>Shipping and Air Transport</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 7, profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from a voyage of a ship or aircraft where the principal purpose of the voyage is to transport passengers or property between places in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. In this Article, profits derived by an enterprise of one of the Contracting States from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic include:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) gross receipts and revenues derived directly from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) interest on sums generated directly from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic provided that such interest is incidental to the operation;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) profits from the rental of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic;

In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contacting States shall if necessary consult each other.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. A Contracting State shall not change the profits of a person in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 after the expiry of the time limits provided in its national laws and, in any case, after six years from the end of the taxable period in which the profits which would be subject to such change would, but for the conditions referred to in paragraph 1, have accrued to that person.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply in the case of fraud or wilful default.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 10<br>Dividends</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Dividends paid by a company, which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other Contracting State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) except in the case of dividends paid by a non-resident-owned investment corporation that is a resident of Canada, 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which controls directly or indirectly 10 per cent or more of the voting power in the company paying the dividends;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.</p></li></ul><p class="indent-0-0">This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as any income or distribution assimilated to income from shares under the taxation laws of the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends or income or making the distribution is a resident.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in the other Contracting State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State, or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing on the earnings of a company attributable to a permanent establishment in that State, a tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a national of that State, provided that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this provision, the term “earnings” means the profits attributable to a permanent establishment in a Contracting State (including gains from the alienation of property forming part of the business property of such a permanent establishment) in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) business losses attributable to such a permanent establishment (including losses from the alienation of property forming part of the business property of such a permanent establishment) in such year and previous years;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) all taxes, other than the additional tax referred to in this paragraph, imposed on such profits in that State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) the profits reinvested in that State as determined in accordance with the laws of that State;
