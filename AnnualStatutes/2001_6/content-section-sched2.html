In respect of loss of or damage to other luggage, such fault or neglect shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, irrespective of the nature of the incident which caused the loss or damage. In all other cases the burden of proving fault or neglect shall lie with the claimant.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 4<br>Performing carrier</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. If the performance of the carriage or part thereof has been entrusted to a performing carrier, the carrier shall nevertheless remain liable for the entire carriage according to the provisions of this Convention.

Where, in accordance with the law of the court seized of the case, damages are awarded in the form of periodical income payments, the equivalent capital value of those payments shall not exceed the said limit.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, the national law of any State Party to this Convention may fix, as far as carriers who are nationals of such State are concerned, a higher <span class="otherLang" lang="la">per capita</span> limit of liability.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 8<br>Limit of liability for loss of or damage to luggage</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. The liability of the carrier for the loss of or damage to cabin luggage shall in no case exceed 1,800 units of account per passenger, per carriage.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. The liability of the carrier for the loss of or damage to vehicles including all luggage carried in or on the vehicle shall in no case exceed 10,000 units of account per vehicle, per carriage.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3. The liability of the carrier for the loss of or damage to luggage other than that mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article shall in no case exceed 2,700 units of account per passenger, per carriage.</p><p class="indent-1-0">4. The carrier and the passenger may agree that the liability of the carrier shall be subject to a deductible not exceeding 300 units of account in the case of damage to a vehicle and not exceeding 135 units of account per passenger in the case of loss of or damage to other luggage, such sum to be deducted from the loss or damage.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 9<br>Unit of account and conversion</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. The unit of account mentioned in this Convention is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in article 7, paragraph 1, and article 8 shall be converted into the national currency of the State of the court seized of the case on the basis of the value of that currency by reference to the Special Drawing Right on the date of the judgment or the date agreed upon by the parties. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect on the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State Party.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. Nevertheless, a State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article may, at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention or at any time thereafter, declare that the unit of account referred to in paragraph 1 shall be equal to 15 gold francs. The gold franc referred to in this paragraph corresponds to sixty-five-and-a-half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of the gold franc into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3. The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1, and the conversion mentioned in paragraph 2 shall be made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of the States Parties, as far as possible, the same real value for the amounts in article 7, paragraph 1, and article 8 as would result from the application of the first three sentences of paragraph 1. States shall communicate to the Secretary-General the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1, or the result of the conversion in paragraph 2, as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 10<br>Supplementary provisions on limits of liability</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. The carrier and the passenger may agree, expressly and in writing, to higher limits of liability than those prescribed in Articles 7 and 8.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. Interest on damages and legal costs shall not be included in the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 7 and 8.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 11<br>Defences and limits for carriers’ servants</h3><p class="indent-1-0">If an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier or of the performing carrier arising out of a damage covered by this Convention, such servant or agent, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, shall be entitled to avail himself of the defences and limits of liability which the carrier or the performing carrier is entitled to invoke under this Convention.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 12<br>Aggregation of claims</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. Where the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 7 and 8 take effect, they shall apply to the aggregate of the amounts recoverable in all claims arising out of the death of or personal injury to any one passenger or the loss of or damage to his luggage.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. In relation to the carriage performed by a performing carrier, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier and the performing carrier and from their servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment shall not exceed the highest amount which could be awarded against either the carrier or the performing carrier under this Convention, but none of the persons mentioned shall be liable for a sum in excess of the limit applicable to him.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3. In any case where a servant or agent of the carrier or of the performing carrier is entitled under Article 11 of this Convention to avail himself of the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 7 and 8, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, or the performing carrier as the case may be, and from that servant or agent, shall not exceed those limits.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 13<br>Loss of right to limit liability</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. The carrier shall not be entitled to the benefit of the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 7 and 8 and paragraph 1 of Article 10, if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier done with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. The servant or agent of the carrier or of the performing carrier shall not be entitled to the benefit of those limits if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of that servant or agent done with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 14<br>Basis for claims</h3><p class="indent-1-0">No action for damages for the death of or personal injury to a passenger, or for the loss of or damage to luggage, shall be brought against a carrier or performing carrier otherwise than in accordance with this Convention.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 15<br>Notice of loss or damage to luggage</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. The passenger shall give written notice to the carrier or his agent:</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) in the case of apparent damage to luggage:</p><p class="indent-2-2">(i) for cabin luggage, before or at the time of disembarkation of the passenger;</p><p class="indent-2-2">(ii) for all other luggage, before or at the time of its re-delivery;</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) in the case of damage to luggage which is not apparent, or loss of luggage, within fifteen days from the date of disembarkation or re-delivery or from the time when such re-delivery should have taken place.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. If the passenger fails to comply with this Article, he shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have received the luggage undamaged.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3. The notice in writing need not be given if the condition of the luggage has at the time of its receipt been the subject of joint survey or inspection.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 16<br>Time-bar for actions</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. Any action for damages arising out of the death of or personal injury to a passenger or of the loss of or damage to luggage shall be time-barred after a period of two years.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. The limitation period shall be calculated as follows:</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) in the case of personal injury, from the date of disembarkation of the passenger;</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) in the case of death occurring during carriage, from the date when the passenger should have disembarked, and in the case of personal injury occurring during carriage and resulting in the death of the passenger after disembarkation, from the date of death, provided that this period shall not exceed three years from the date of disembarkation;</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) in the case of loss of or damage to luggage, from the date of disembarkation or from the date when disembarkation should have taken place, whichever is later.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3. The law of the court seized of the case shall govern the grounds of suspension and interruption of limitation periods, but in no case shall an action under this Convention be brought after the expiration of a period of three years from the date of disembarkation of the passenger or from the date when disembarkation should have taken place, whichever is later.</p><p class="indent-1-0">4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article, the period of limitation may be extended by a declaration of the carrier or by agreement of the parties after the cause of action has arisen. The declaration or agreement shall be in writing.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 17<br>Competent jurisdiction</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. An action arising under this Convention shall, at the option of the claimant, be brought before one of the courts listed below, provided that the court is located in a State Party to this Convention:</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) the court of the place of permanent residence or principal place of business of the defendant, or</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) the court of the place of departure or that of the destination according to the contract of carriage, or</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) a court of the State of the domicile or permanent residence of the claimant, if the defendant has a place of business and is subject to jurisdiction in that State, or</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) a court of the State where the contract of carriage was made, if the defendant has a place of business and is subject to jurisdiction in that State.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. After the occurrence of the incident which has caused the damage, the parties may agree that the claim for damages shall be submitted to any jurisdiction or to arbitration.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 18<br>Invalidity of contractual provisions</h3><p class="indent-1-0">Any contractual provision concluded before the occurrence of the incident which has caused the death of or personal injury to a passenger or the loss of or damage to his luggage, purporting to relieve the carrier of his liability towards the passenger or to prescribe a lower limit of liability than that fixed in this Convention except as provided in paragraph 4 of Article 8, and any such provision purporting to shift the burden of proof which rests on the carrier, or having the effect of restricting the option specified in paragraph 1 of Article 17, shall be null and void, but the nullity of that provision shall not render void the contract of carriage which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 19<br>Other conventions on limitation of liability</h3><p class="indent-1-0">This Convention shall not modify the rights or duties of the carrier, the performing carrier, and their servants or agents provided for in international conventions relating to the limitation of liability

class="SchedHeadL2">Article 22<br>Declaration of non-application</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. Any Party may at the time of signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to this Convention,
