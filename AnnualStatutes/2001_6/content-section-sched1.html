The value of a national currency in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect at the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State Party.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. Nevertheless, those States which are not members of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 may, at the time of signature without reservation as to ratification, acceptance or approval or at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limits of liability provided for in this Convention to be applied in their territories shall be fixed as follows:</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) in respect of article 6, paragraph 1(<em>a</em>) at an amount of:</p><p class="indent-2-2">(i) 30 million monetary units for a ship with a tonnage not exceeding 2,000 tons;</p><p class="indent-2-2">(ii) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, the following amount in addition to that mentioned in (i):</p><p class="indent-3-3">for each ton from 2,001 to 30,000 tons, 12,000 monetary units;</p><p class="indent-3-3">for each ton from 30,001 to 70,000 tons, 9,000 monetary units; and</p><p class="indent-3-3">for each ton in excess of 70,000 tons, 6,000 monetary units; and</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) in respect of article 6, paragraph 1(<em>b</em>), at an amount of:</p><p class="indent-2-2">(i) 15 million monetary units for a ship with a tonnage not exceeding 2,000 tons;</p><p class="indent-2-2">(ii) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, the following amount in addition to that mentioned in (i):</p><p class="indent-3-3">for each ton from 2,001 to 30,000 tons, 6,000 monetary units;</p><p class="indent-3-3">for each ton from 30,001 to 70,000 tons, 4,500 monetary units; and</p><p class="indent-3-3">for each ton in excess of 70,000 tons, 3,000 monetary units; and</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) in respect of article 7, paragraph 1, at an amount of 2,625,000 monetary units multiplied by the number of passengers which the ship is authorized to carry according to its certificate.</p></li></ul><p class="indent-0-0">Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 6 apply correspondingly to subparagraphs (<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>) of this paragraph.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3. The monetary unit referred to in paragraph 2 corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred.

States Parties shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1, or the result of the conversion in paragraph 3, as the case may be, at the time of the signature without reservation as to ratification, acceptance or approval, or when depositing an instrument referred to in Article 16 and whenever there is a change in either.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 9<br>Aggregation of claims</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. The limits of liability determined in accordance with Article 6 shall apply to the aggregate of all claims which arise on any distinct occasion:</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) against the person or persons mentioned in paragraph 2 of Article 1 and any person for whose act, neglect or default he or they are responsible; or</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) against the shipowner of a ship rendering salvage services from that ship and the salvor or salvors operating from such ship and any person for whose act, neglect or default he or they are responsible; or</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) against the salvor or salvors who are not operating from a ship or who are operating solely on the ship to or in respect of which the salvage services are rendered and any person for whose act, neglect or default he or they are responsible.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. The limits of liability determined in accordance with Article 7 shall apply to the aggregate of all claims subject thereto which may arise on any distinct occasion against the person or persons mentioned in paragraph 2 of Article 1 in respect of the ship referred to in Article 7 and any person for whose act, neglect or default he or they are responsible.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 10<br>Limitation of liability without constitution of a limitation fund</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. Limitation of liability may be invoked notwithstanding that a limitation fund as mentioned in Article 11 has not been constituted. However, a State Party may provide in its national law that, where an action is brought in its Courts to enforce a claim subject to limitation, a person liable may only invoke the right to limit liability if a limitation fund has been constituted in accordance with the provisions of this Convention or is constituted when the right to limit liability is invoked.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. If limitation of liability is invoked without the constitution of a limitation fund, the provisions of Article 12 shall apply correspondingly.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3. Questions of procedure arising under the rules of this Article shall be decided in accordance with the national law of the State Party in which action is brought.</p><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">CHAPTER III.

The fund shall be constituted in the sum of such of the amounts set out in Articles 6 and 7 as are applicable to claims for which that person may be liable, together with interest thereon from the date of the occurrence giving rise to the liability until the date of the constitution of the fund. Any fund thus constituted shall be available only for the payment of claims in respect of which limitation of liability can be invoked.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. A fund may be constituted, either by depositing the sum, or by producing a guarantee acceptable under the legislation of the State Party where the fund is constituted and considered to be adequate by the Court or other competent authority.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3. A fund constituted by one of the persons mentioned in paragraph 1(<em>a</em>), (<em>b</em>) or (<em>c</em>) or paragraph 2 of Article 9 or his insurer shall be deemed constituted by all persons mentioned in paragraph 1(<em>a</em>), (<em>b</em>) or (<em>c</em>) or paragraph 2, respectively.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 12<br>Distribution of the fund</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Article 6 and of Article 7, the fund shall be distributed among the claimants in proportion to their established claims against the fund.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. If, before the fund is distributed, the person liable, or his insurer, has settled a claim against the fund such person shall, up to the amount he has paid, acquire by subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would have enjoyed under this Convention.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3. The right of subrogation provided for in paragraph 2 may also be exercised by persons other than those therein mentioned in respect of any amount of compensation which they may have paid, but only to the extent that such subrogation is permitted under the applicable national law.</p><p class="indent-1-0">4. Where the person liable or any other person establishes that he may be compelled to pay, at a later date, in whole or in part any such amount of compensation with regard to which such person would have enjoyed a right of subrogation pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 had the compensation been paid before the fund was distributed, the Court or other competent authority of the State where the fund has been constituted may order that a sufficient sum shall be provisionally set aside to enable such person at such later date to enforce his claim against the fund.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 13<br>Bar to other actions</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. Where a limitation fund has been constituted in accordance with Article 11, any person having made a claim against the fund shall be barred from exercising any right in respect of such claim against any other assets of a person by or on behalf of whom the fund has been constituted.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. After a limitation fund has been constituted in accordance with Article 11, any ship or other property, belonging to a person on behalf of whom the fund has been constituted, which has been arrested or attached within the jurisdiction of a State Party for a claim which may be raised against the fund, or any security given, may be released by order of the Court or other competent authority of such State. However, such release shall always be ordered if the limitation fund has been constituted:</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) at the port where the occurrence took place, or, if it took place out of port, at the first port of call thereafter; or</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) at the port of disembarkation in respect of claims for loss of life or personal injury; or</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) at the port of discharge in respect of damage to cargo; or</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) in the State where the arrest is made.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3. The rules of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply only if the claimant may bring a claim against the limitation fund before the Court administering that fund and the fund is actually available and freely transferable in respect of that claim.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 14<br>Governing law</h3><p class="indent-1-0">Subject to the provisions of this Chapter the rules relating to the constitution and distribution of a limitation fund, and all rules of procedure in connexion therewith, shall be governed by the law of the State Party in which the fund is constituted.</p><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">CHAPTER IV.

Nevertheless, each State Party may exclude wholly or partially from the application of this Convention any person referred to in Article 1 who at the time when the rules of this Convention are invoked before the Courts of that State does not have his habitual residence in a State Party or does not have his principal place of business in a State Party or any ship in relation to which the right of limitation is invoked or whose release is sought and which does not at the time specified above fly the flag of a State Party.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. A State Party may regulate by specific provisions of national law the system of limitation of liability to be applied to vessels which are:</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) according to the law of that State, ships intended for navigation on inland waterways;</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) ships of less than 300 tons.</p><p class="indent-0-0">A State Party which makes use of the option provided for in this paragraph shall inform the depositary of the limits of liability adopted in its national legislation or of the fact that there are none.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3. A State Party may regulate by specific provisions of national law the system of limitation of liability to be applied to claims arising in cases in which interests of persons who are nationals of other States Parties are in no way involved.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3<span class="otherLang" lang="la">bis</span>. Notwithstanding the limit of liability prescribed in paragraph 1 of Article 7, a State Party may regulate by specific provisions of national law the system of liability to be applied to claims for loss of life or personal injury to passengers of a ship, provided that the limit of liability is not lower than that prescribed in paragraph 1 of Article 7. A State Party which makes use of the option provided for in this paragraph shall inform the Secretary-General of the limits of liability adopted or of the fact that there are none.</p><p class="indent-1-0">4. The Courts of a State Party shall not apply this Convention to ships constructed for, or adapted to, and engaged in, drilling:</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) when that State has established under its national legislation a higher limit of liability than that otherwise provided for in Article 6; or</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) when that State has become party to an international convention regulating the system of liability in respect of such ships.</p><p class="indent-0-0">In a case to which sub-paragraph (<em>a</em>) applies that State Party shall inform the depositary accordingly.</p><p class="indent-1-0">5. This Convention shall not apply to:</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) air-cushion vehicles;</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) floating platforms constructed for the purpose of exploring or exploiting the natural resources of the sea-bed or the subsoil thereof.</p><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">PART 2<br></h2><p class="indent-1-0">Text of Article 18 of the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976, as amended by the Protocol of 1996 to amend the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976, and of Articles 8 and 9 of that Protocol</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 18<br>Reservations</h3><p class="indent-1-0">1. Any State may, at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or at any time thereafter, reserve the right:</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) to exclude the application of article 2, paragraphs 1(<em>d</em>) and (<em>e</em>);</p><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) to exclude claims for damage within the meaning of the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, 1996 or of any amendment or Protocol thereto.</p><p class="indent-0-0">No other reservations shall be admissible to the substantive provisions of this Convention.</p><p class="indent-1-0">2. Reservations made at the time of signature are subject to confirmation upon ratification, acceptance or approval.</p><p class="indent-1-0">3. Any State which has made a reservation to this Convention may withdraw it at any time by means of a notification addressed to the Secretary-General.
