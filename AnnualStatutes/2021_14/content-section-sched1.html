developments affecting them and their lands, territories and resources will enable them to maintain and strengthen their institutions, cultures and traditions, and to promote their development in accordance with their aspirations and needs,</p><p class="indent-0-0"><em>Recognizing</em> that respect for indigenous knowledge, cultures and traditional practices contributes to sustainable and equitable development and proper management of the environment,</p><p class="indent-0-0"><em>Emphasizing</em> the contribution of the demilitarization of the lands and territories of indigenous peoples to peace, economic and social progress and development, understanding and friendly relations among nations and peoples of the world,</p><p class="indent-0-0"><em>Recognizing in particular</em> the right of indigenous families and communities to retain shared responsibility for the upbringing, training, education and well-being of their children, consistent with the rights of the child,</p><p class="indent-0-0"><em>Considering</em> that the rights affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements between States and indigenous peoples are, in some situations, matters of international concern, interest, responsibility and character,</p><p class="indent-0-0"><em>Considering also</em> that treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements, and the relationship they represent, are the basis for a strengthened partnership between indigenous peoples and States,</p><p class="indent-0-0"><em>Acknowledging</em> that the Charter of the United Nations,
