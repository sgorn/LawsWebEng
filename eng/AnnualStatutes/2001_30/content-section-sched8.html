The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property and to income from the alienation of such property.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 7<br>Business Profits</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on or has carried on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on or has carried on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on or has carried on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed those deductible expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment including executive and general administrative expenses, whether incurred in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then, the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 8<br>Shipping and Air Transport</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Profits of an

a Contracting State from the use or rental of containers (including trailers, barges, and related equipment for the transport of containers) used in international traffic shall be taxable only in that

the voyage is to transport passengers or property between places in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 9<br>Associated Enterprises</h3><p class="indent-1-0">Where</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,</p></li></ul><p class="indent-0-0">and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 10<br>Dividends</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if a resident of the other Contracting State is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company that controls at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.</p></li></ul><p class="indent-0-0">The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) dividends on shares including income from shares, “jouissance” shares or “jouissance” rights, mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) other income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident, and for the purpose of taxation in the Federal Republic of Germany, income derived

“Gewinnobligationen” (profit sharing bonds) and similar remuneration which is dependent on profits as well as distributions on certificates of an investment trust.</p></li></ul></li><li><p

Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State and not also a resident of the other Contracting State derives profits or income from the other State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, Canada may impose on the earnings of a company attributable to permanent establishments in Canada, or on the earnings attributable to the alienation of immovable property situated in Canada by a company carrying on a trade in immovable property, tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company that is a resident of Canada, provided that the rate of such additional tax so imposed shall not exceed the percentage limitation provided for under subparagraph (<em>a</em>) of paragraph 2 of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years.

However, the term “interest” does not include income dealt with in Article 10.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State.
