The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitation of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. If specifically requested by the competent authority of a Contracting State, the competent authority of the other Contracting State shall endeavour to provide information under this Article in the form requested, such as depositions of witnesses and copies of unedited original documents (including books, papers, statements, records, accounts or writings), to the same extent such depositions and documents can be obtained under the laws and administrative practices of that other State with respect to its own taxes.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 25<br>Diplomatic Agents and Consular Officers</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic agents or consular officers under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 4, an individual who is a member of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a Contracting State that is situated in the other Contracting State or in a third State shall be deemed for the purposes of the Convention to be a resident of the sending State if that individual is liable in the sending State to the same obligations in relation to tax on total income as are residents of that sending State.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 26<br>Miscellaneous Rules</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The provisions of this Convention shall not be construed to restrict in any manner any exemption, allowance, credit or other deduction accorded:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1"><em>a</em>) by the laws of a Contracting State in the determination of the tax imposed by that State; or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1"><em>b</em>) by any other agreement entered into by a Contracting State.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Nothing in the Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing a tax on amounts included in the income of a resident of that State with respect to a partnership, trust, or controlled foreign affiliate, in which the resident has an interest.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The Convention shall not apply to any company, trust, partnership or other entity that is a resident of a Contracting State and is beneficially owned or controlled directly or indirectly by one or more persons who are not residents of that State, if the amount of the tax imposed on the income of the company, trust, partnership or entity by that State (after taking into account any reduction or offset of the amount of tax in any manner, including a refund, reimbursement, contribution, credit or allowance to the company, trust, partnership or other person) is substantially lower than the amount that would be imposed by the State if all of the shares of the capital stock of the company or all of the interests in the trust, partnership or any other entity, as the case may be, were beneficially owned by one or more individuals who were residents of that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Where under any provision of the Convention any income is relieved from tax in a Contracting State and, under the law in force in the other Contracting State a person, in respect of that income, is subject to tax by reference to the amount thereof that is remitted to or received in that other Contracting State and not by reference to the full amount thereof, then the relief to be allowed under the Convention in the first-mentioned Contracting State shall apply only to so much of the income as is taxed in the other Contracting State.</p></li></ul><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">VI.
